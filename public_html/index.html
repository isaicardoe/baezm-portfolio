        First of all my name is Isai Cardoso as you can see at the top. I like to play any sport but my favorite
        is soccer its the best sport in the world in my opinion. My favorite soccer player is Leon Messi 
        My favorite foods are probably tortas no lie, tacos, and probably my grandma's tamales. I like to
        crack some jokes sometimes when the teachers are chill. I play soccer almost everyday my favorite soccer
        team is Barcelona and Chelsea they are on top of there leagues

        One of the projects I have done is Cookie Clicker i made my own version and made it work. 
        It was one of the most proud things I have made it was kind of hard but i asked questions and 
        got my work done I also made another game called breakout. I was kind of challenged on the math
        of how when it hit the paddle and it has to bounce of the other angle and make the bricks disapear
        and make the score go up. I am happy and satisfied on what i have created.

        <p>
        The App Academy has taught me a lot of useful ideas and skills i might use later on in my life.
        Like getting a job it is very hard now in days to get a job and now mostly everything has to 
        do with electronics. Like the incredible Mr.Dan he has taught us use full skills we can use to get jobs
        and be succesfull in life our life.
